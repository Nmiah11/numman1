Scenario: The account balance is £0, when a customer makes a transaction of £10, the balance on the account should be -£10

Current Balance: 0.00
Transaction: £10
Expected balance: -£10.00

Integration test:

A seperate system will send an api (POST) request to debit the account for £10.

The banking system will then debit the account.

The banking system will send a respone back to the requestor to say its succesfull.

The requesting system will get the response and act accordingly.

System test:

Scenario = 
1) POST API to update account
2) Account is updated
3) Request goes back to sender
4) once the sender gets the response, they create a report on the back of it. 
5) the report is sent out and statement is generated.
